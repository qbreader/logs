# qbreader/logs

A repository to manage the logs produced by [qbreader](https://www.qbreader.org).
Produces summary data of the most popular sets and most active users (by IP) for the given raw logs.

## Privacy

Any files containing IP address should be hidden from this public repository by placing them in a `raw.log` file or by appropriately modifying the `.gitignore` file.

## Obtaining Logs

QB Reader is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with [Logtail](https://betterstack.com/logtail) integration.
We are interested in how often certain sets are requested (not including multiplayer).
Specific types of logs are queried from Logtail using Grafana with the following SQL queries (section below).
The values are saved in `raw.log` (in the appropriate folder) and processed using the `summarize.py` script.

### Singleplayer Packet Requests

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND message LIKE 'at=info method=GET path="/api/packet%'
```

### Singleplayer Random Questions

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND proc_id = 'web.1'
    AND message LIKE '[DATABASE] RANDOM QUESTIONS%'
```

### Database Queries

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND proc_id = 'web.1'
    AND message LIKE '[DATABASE] QUERY%'
```

### Multiplayer Connections

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND proc_id = 'web.1'
    AND message LIKE 'Connection%'
```

### Light/Dark Mode

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND message LIKE 'at=info method=GET path="/bootstrap/light.css"%'
```

For dark mode, swap out `light.css` for `dark.css`.
