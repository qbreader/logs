Any files containing IP address should be hidden from this public repository by placing them in a `raw.log` file or by appropriately modifying the `.gitignore` file.

## Obtaining Logs

[qbreader](https://www.qbreader.org/) is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with [Logtail](https://betterstack.com/logtail) integration.
Specific types of logs are queried from Logtail using Grafana with the following SQL queries (see section below).
The values are saved in `raw.log` (in the appropriate folder) and processed using the `summarize.py` script.
