# Premise

A common debate[^1] is whether light or dark mode is better.
This is an attempt to document which is more popular on [qbreader](https://www.qbreader.org).

## Technical Details

If a user has a system preference, then qbreader uses that.
Otherwise, qbreader defaults to the previously selected mode.
If no mode has been selected, then qbreader defaults to light mode.

## Results

2022-11-24 to 2022-12-01:

```
Light:  9403 (69.7%)
Dark:   4079 (30.3%)
Total: 13482 (100.0%)
```

[^1]: It's not a debate, since dark mode is clearly superior.
