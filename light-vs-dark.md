# Premise

A common debate[^1] is whether light or dark mode is better.
This is an attempt to document which is more popular on [qbreader](https://www.qbreader.org).

## Technical Details

If a user has a system preference, then qbreader uses that.
Otherwise, qbreader defaults to the previously selected mode.
If no mode has been selected, then qbreader defaults to dark mode[^2].

The following SQL queries are used to determine the number of requests for light and dark mode.

### Light/Dark Mode

To find the **total** number of visits (not just dark mode), use the following SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT message
FROM $table

WHERE
    dt BETWEEN toDateTime64($from, 3)
    AND toDateTime64($to, 3)
    AND message LIKE 'at=info method=GET path="/bootstrap/dark.css"%'
```

Explanation: when a user visits qbreader, the server logs a request for `dark.css`.
If their preference is light mode, then the client makes an _additional_ request for `light.css`.

For light mode, swap out `dark.css` for `light.css`.

[^1]: It's not a debate, since dark mode is clearly superior.
[^2]: I attempted to change the default theme [from light mode to dark mode](https://github.com/qbreader/website/commit/d267dcebe84a6e2309b4e1c89d6e03156efcc661) on 2023-02-10, but I did not actually change anything. I successfully changed it [here](https://github.com/qbreader/website/commit/12f2e6842d48cae53fa2993a06b9212b06345f46).
[^3]: Over the course of 2023-02-10 to 2023-02-13, the server was DDoS'd, so Grafana was unable to store all the logs and I had to delete and restart log collection.
[^4]: The first week that the default theme was dark mode.
