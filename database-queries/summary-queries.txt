a model for one type of this phenomenon ensemble averages over all possible angles of orientation, and a over distance to the twelfth minus b over distance to the sixth gives its potential. a term for polarizability is introduced in an equation for the debye type of this phenomenon. moles squared over volume squared times a corrects for this in the van der waals equation. this type of interaction may also result in a partial charge on a hydrogen atom and a dipole moment, and noble gases can attract one another by the london dispersion type.  for 10 points,  identify these interactions, including van der waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which occur between molecules. 1
